**BlackJack**

You are tasked with creating blackjack. allow up to 4 players per game and display how much money each player has. each player is given a $500 initial bet. if you do not know how blackjack is played, the rules are listed below:

In Blackjack, every player is betting against the dealer. The individual non-dealer players aren’t playing against one another.
The goal of the game is to get a higher hand than the dealer without going over 21. Going over 21 is called busting.
If a player has a better hand than the dealer without busting, they win their bet. If they have a worse hand, the dealer takes their bet.

The goal of Blackjack is to beat the dealer’s hand without going over 21.
In Blackjack, every player is competing against the dealer—not each other. In a given round, the player’s ultimate goal is to get a hand that’s higher than the dealer’s (without being higher than 21, or "busting"). 
Only by beating the dealer can a player win their bet. Players determine the value of their hand by tallying up the point values of their cards: 
2 through 10: The number listed on the card (e.g., 2 is worth 2 points)
Jack, Queen, King: 10 points
Ace: 1 or 11 points (the player gets to choose)
An Ace and a 10, Jack, Queen, or King equals 21 points and is known as a Blackjack.

Rules:

Using whatever betting materials they have on hand, each player wagers a certain amount of currency (before they even get their cards). 
All players must submit their bets before the round officially start

**The dealer gives a card to each player as well as themselves.**

The dealer hands a card face-up to each player and then places a card face-down in front of themselves. It’s okay if the players can see each others’ hands—all that matters is that they can’t see the dealer’s first card.
A 52-card card deck is used to play Blackjack. The dealer needs to remove the Jokers and shuffle the cards before distributing them.

**The dealer hands out a second card to every player.**

As they did before, the dealer passes another face-up card to each player. 
This time, though, the dealer places their second card face-up in their hand (leaving the first card face-down still)


**The player to the left of the dealer starts gameplay**

To keep things organized, have the player left of the dealer go first each round; from there, gameplay continues in a clockwise direction


**Decide if you want to stay or hit.**

Take a look at your 2 cards and add the numerical total together—how close is it to 21, and how does it compare to the dealer’s hand? If the total is pretty high (like 17 or 18, which is very close to 21), “staying” (leaving your hand as-is) is probably your best option. 
if your total is on the low end (like in the single digits), “hitting,” or getting another card added to your hand, could be beneficial.
Staying simply means that you don’t want the dealer to give you another card that’ll get added to your total. This is signified by holding your hand flat and waving it.
Hitting means that you’d like the dealer to add another card to your hand, and is signified by tapping the game table with your pointer and middle finger. You can hit as many times as you’d like until you reach or go over 21.

**Cycle through each player until they’ve each finished their turn.**

Give each player time to look over their cards and let the dealer know if they’d like to hit or stay. Players who hit too often may end up busting, or getting a card total that’s over 21. 
They automatically lose the round as well as their initial bet

**The dealer reveals their second card and winners are determined.**

At this point, the dealer flips over their original card to reveal their hand total. If the total is 16 or lower, they’re required to hit and take another card. If the card is 17 or higher, the dealer is required to stay.
If the dealer gets a Blackjack, all the players automatically lose the round, unless they have a Blackjack themselves. In this case, they push—in other words, the player who got Blackjack simply gets their original bet back. 
A push also occurs anytime the player’s hand matches the dealer’s.


**Bets are paid out and a new round begins.**

Any player with a hand that’s higher than the dealer’s (but not higher than 21) wins the round (unless they busted). 
All winning hand gets paid in a 1 to 1 ratio; if you bet 1 chip, you win 1. If you have a 21-point (Blackjack) hand, you typically get paid out at a 3 to 2 ratio—so, if you bet 2 chips for the round, you’d get rewarded with 3 (leaving you with 5 total chips)
After the round ends, the dealer collects the cards, shuffles them, and starts a new round

BONUS: incorporate special gameplay techniques

**Splitting**

If your second card is identical to your first (e.g., two 8 cards), you have the option to “split” your hand into 2 separate ones. Place the same number of chips down for your split bet, and then ask for the dealer to “hit” each of your hands. 
Think of splitting as just giving yourself an extra turn for the round—each hand is separate from the other. Even if one hand busts, you still continue playing with your other hand.
If you split 2 Aces, the player can only hit each hand one time. If you end up getting a point total of 21 on one of your hands, this isn’t considered a Blackjack (in terms of payout), but it still pushes if the dealer gets a Blackjack.
Any 2 cards with the same point value can split, like a Queen and a Jack (which are both worth 10 points).[15] This rule varies by casino, though, so double-check with your dealer before you try this maneuver.
Separate your pointer and middle finger into a “V” shape and place them on the table to let the dealer know that you’re splitting.

**Doubling down**

You have the option to “double down,” or double your initial bet before the dealer gives you another card—this gives you the chance to earn significantly more money in a single go. 
Doubling down only lets you hit once, but it can be a lucrative way to have a successful round if you feel that luck is on your side.
It’s best to double down when you have a lower hand, like an Ace/11, since getting a 10-value card would jump you up to a Blackjack.
Signal to the dealer that you want to double down by touching an extended pointer finger to the game table.
If you don’t feel like doubling your bet, feel free to bet a lower amount instead.
You can double down on any hand that’s lower than 21, including split hands. The main thing to remember is that you can’t hit after you’ve doubled-down.


**Surrendering**

If you have an especially bad hand, “surrender” to the dealer instead of hitting or staying.
Surrendering deducts 50% off your original bet, but it can save you from a total loss.

**Side-betting (insurance)**

All players have the opportunity to place a side bet (better known as “insurance”) whenever the dealer’s first card appears as an Ace—by placing a bet, you believe that the dealer has a 10-point value card face-down in their hand (thus giving them a Blackjack). 
This “insurance” bet can be equal to or less than your original bet.
If the dealer has a Blackjack: Your first bet loses (unless your hand is a Blackjack as well), but your side bet gets a 2 to 1 payout. For example, if you bet 1 chip on the side bet, you’d get 2 back (giving you 3 total).
If the dealer doesn’t have a Blackjack: You lose all the chips you put down for the insurance bet.
